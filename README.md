The end-to-end folder shows how to use the LLM Frame Semantic Parser with candidate targets.

1. You must retrieve your own copy of FrameNet 1.7 from https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/download if you would like to do your own training. 
2. The Phi-4 model has been uploaded to Hugging Face at `jdevasier/phi4-fsp`.
